# Save Tracker

Have been thinking about this for a long time and finally am getting around to creating it. Thought that people would love to have a way to go back on previous saves and look at their past players, results, trophies, records or even the teams that are their bogey teams.

A way to track your Saves by exporting with specific filters that will be in the Steam Workshop as well as downloadable from the application itself.

### **Tools Used:**
  - Wails (Go)
  - Typescript
  - Vue Framework
  - SQLite (Embedded database)
  - PrimeVue components
  
  
### **Features:**
  - Attribute Tracking
  - Stats
  - Transfers
  - Results
  - Save Goals
  
### **Installation**
*TBD*

### **Possible Future Features:**
~No guarantee I will add all or any of these~
  - [ ] Comparisons between players
  - [ ] Track multiple teams managed in 1 save (for like Journeyman, Glory Hunter, etc)
  - [ ] Results w/ Head-to-head (separated by competition, etc)
  - [ ] League Positions
  - [ ] Coaching Staff
  - [ ] Formations
  - [ ] Team Info (Facilities, Stadium name, capacity, etc)
  - [ ] Youth Intakes
  - [ ] Trophies (team + personal)
  - [ ] Place to add a written story (per year or add on to a long one
  - [ ] Manager Timelines (only if they can be exported)
  - [ ] Easy export to share with others
